# VoID Generator Docker

Generates a Docker image for the [VoID description generator by Jerven Bolleman](https://github.com/JervenBolleman/void-generator).  
The build also creates an alias for the built `jar`-file called `void-generator.jar`, which is a static name, regardless of version.

docker pull redpencil/void-generator-docker
